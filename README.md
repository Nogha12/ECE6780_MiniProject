# ECE 6780 Embedded System Design -- Mini-Project
**University of Utah, Electrical and Computer Engineering**

### Project Members:

- Noah Lomu
- David Venegas
- Skylar Stockham

### Description:

We will develop an LED driver that can interface with an off-the-shelf LED strip. The level of each color will be represented with an 8-bit integer representing 256 different PWM duty cycles (over 16 million colors in total). The LEDs’ color will be controlled by the onboard gyroscope; the color space of the LED strip will be mapped to the 3D space of the gyroscope’s orientation. If there is time, the intensity of the LEDs can be controlled by the onboard touch sensor.

### Milestones:

- **Milestone #1:** The driver can display any color on the LED strip.
- **Milestone #2:** The driver can map a normalized 3D vector to an RGB value.
- **Milestone #3:** The gyroscope can be read and used to control the LEDs.
